## About 
This project is a part of the Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) Fall 2022 at Georgia Gwinnett College. This project leverages the power of the Unity Game Engine to impart programming principles to individuals with limited or no prior coding experience, extending a welcoming hand to newcomers in both coding and the broader realm of IT. Through engaging learning modules and innovative experiences with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to ignite a passion for discovery and learning within each participant, fostering a deeper appreciation for the vast potential of the IT sector.
## Description
1. Difficult Level: Hard
2. Target Audience: 6th Grade to College.
3.  Duration of workshop: 45 to 60 minutes.
4.  Needed materials: Unity Hub and Unity Game Engine.
5.  Learning outcomes: This project aims to create engaging hands-on learning activities using the Unity game engine to demonstrate STEM concepts and logical expressions. Through various outreach activities, this project works toward attracting more students to enroll in the IT field as their future career.
6.  Workshop description: Students will be introduced to the boolean concept utilizing in-game assests as mini tests. Then, students will be introduced to the Fruit Ninja website where they will be able to play the game.
