## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to teach participants the concept of boolean logic through Unity, providing a hands-on foundation in game development and logical problem-solving.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants follow along with a hands-on level building tutorial, where they build a simple scene and learn how to use Unity's tools and C# scripting to bring their level to fruition.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Participants begin the workshop by playing Slice IT!, a fast-paced game where players slice objects that match a given boolean statement while avoiding incorrect objects and hazards. The game highlights logic-based gameplay, quick reflexes, and dynamic challenges, showcasing Unity’s capabilities through engaging mechanics, vibrant visuals, and interactive design. This initial experience introduces participants to the elements of a polished game, such as logic-driven mechanics, physics-based interactions, and user feedback. After playing, participants transition into creating their own level within Unity. This hands-on activity guides them through foundational Unity concepts, such as scene setup, scripting boolean logic, and integrating assets, providing a practical introduction to game development.

* [Unity](https://Unity.com/games) is a versatile game engine for creating 2D, 3D, VR, and AR experiences across multiple platforms, using C# scripting and real-time rendering.
* Unity uses a visual interface combined with C# scripting, letting you design game worlds and mechanics by dragging and dropping objects and components while also writing custom code for detailed control—it's like crafting your own interactive universe!
* Unity was chosen because of its user-friendly interface and powerful tools, making it perfect for creating the game’s simple mechanics and minimalist design. Despite its simplicity, the game includes a slight challenge to engage players, which Unity’s versatility made easy to implement.
